# Baz

This package maps resolved-to-math.js to math.js. Because this works, it proves
that mapping is correct.

## Explanation

Inside `package.json` exports field tells nodejs, which file to load for given
require path.

This is proven to work by mapping resolved-to-math.js to math.js. If we mapped
math.js to math.js we could not know if mapping really works or not. Require
might have resolved original file and ignored mapping.
