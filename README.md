# NodeJS - Scaffolding node modules

For many web developers node modules directory, created by NodeJS is mystery for
a long time.

This project breaks down how it works, how nodejs uses it and how it's
configured.

## Notes

Additional notes about this project.

### Prettier configuration

If you are familiar with prettier, you will wonder why do I have configuration
file without prettier dependency.

My IDE uses it to format my code. This project is not intended to be used by
other developers. No need for environment agnostic configuration.

### Editorconfig file

This file assists code editors and IDEs to format code.

For more info visit: https://editorconfig.org/.

### Node modules are not in .gitignore

This directory is scaffolded for demonstration purposes, it should be present.

In other words, created manually by me.
